Once the homework file was downloaded from the course website. Then sublime text software was donaloaded. The homework file was opened in
the sublime text and a new html file was created which was also opened in the sublime text software. The general html structure was coded
in the html sublime text file and it was linked to the homework file with the functions script and src. Then the html file was opened in Safari
and the instructions were seen on the screen. The id was set to "Saturn" and the style was set based on the instructions seen on the Safari
screen.I then edited the homework code, by adding if and else statement to the conditions at the end. When all of the instruction have been completed and the safari window was refreshed, a flag appeared, which was copied and uploaded
to the course website.
